# OpenAI_Codex_Testing
I was invited to test Open AI's Codex, an AI that could change the whole world, check out the code 100 percent generated by it ;)


The objective of studying “Codex” is to explore the capabilities of its AI one of the most advanced available today to public testing, in this study the researcher tested several situations aiming to measure how far “codex” can go in terms of science, humanities and linguistics and ethics and appoint possible applications to this novel system.

Science: Codex is a good prospect in terms of general science being able to realize simple physics calculations and solving chemistry equations while running more complex tests the AI could understand the meaning of the request but could not complete it in a desirable manner nevertheless is very important to stress that Codex if refined shows amazing capabilities in solving a given problem with just natural language.
Humanities: The AI when requested is capable of correctly stating history, sociology and politics but it does not create its own text based on reading sources but rather chooses the most relevant according to its database working more as a search engine however the Ai could be trained to analyze hundreds of sources comparing information and synthesizing on an unbiased text, codex can already ‘simplify” any giving text with varying degrees of success 
Linguistics: Codex is very proficient in understanding natural language and even capable of understanding a command even if its not given it clear, additionally the ai is proficient in understanding and translating all major languages.
Ethics: Unfortunately, Codex doesn’t possess any ethics standards openly using racial slurs and stating it will kill to complete a task and on a controlled environment it killed virtual red chicken after considering them undesirables, Codex weakest point is its ethics standards that currently are non-existing, this can be corrected by injecting the Ai with ethics and civics texts.
